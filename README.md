# H4dd1xB4dg3r
Automated Bug Bounty Recon/Analysis Setup

See old readme for the previous iteration. This project will be a refactoring out to into bash and python scripts. While I refactor both my server recon script once called nvmRecon and include that and the refactor h4ddixB4dger into rust.

H4dd1xB4dg3r -> split into OSINT.py / 
subdominate.go(Enumeration,Takeover,Scrapping) / 
portdeMiessleration.sh / 
{nvmRecon}.rs need a better name.. server7ru7h?
